  When it comes time to get rid of your car, you have more options than you
  think. Weigh your options based on what the best answer is for you, according
  to your circumstances.

* Traditional options include trade-in to dealer (with new car purchase), sale to dealer (no car purchase), private sale (via classifieds, e.g. Kijiji, AutoTrader, Craigslist)
* New option offered by Autovend: sell to dealers via auction to get the best price
  * faster/safer than private sale
  * less exposed to potential dealer dishonesty than dealer sale/trade-in
  * not for everyone: best suited to sell only (vs. replace)
* Choice depends on your needs; each has pros and cons

1. **Dealer trade-in**
   _Pros_: fastest (same day), they take care of the paperwork, if you're buying a car they can take the old when you pick up the new (no span of time with 0/2 cars), tax advantage (see below), low exposure to fraud (safe)\
   _Cons_: Will resell, so you won't get the same price (wholesale vs. retail)
2. **Dealer auction**\
   _Pros_: quick (7-10 days), guided process (they tell you what work to do, but you have to do it), potentially a better price than a dealer trade-in (depends on the dealer-make match, vehicle condition, market demand), very low exposure to fraud (very safe)\
   _Cons_: still a wholesale price, need to schedule multiple visits (inspection by auction house, pickup by buyer)
3. **Private sale**\
   _Pros_: highest price, most control over the process\
   _Cons_: slow (weeks to months), high exposure to fraud (not safe), need to manage vetting of leads/buyers yourself, need to schedule multiple visits/test drives from potential buyers, very labour-intensive

* Trade-in tax advantage:
  * When buying and selling to the same dealer, the government sees it as one transaction
  * The value of the trade-in is deducted from the value of the new car prior to tax being applied, and tax isn't paid on that amount. So:
    **Scenario 1**: separate purchase and sale
    * $30,000 new car + 13% HST = $33,900
    * $12,000 used car private sale
    * Total Cost: $33,900 - $12,000 = **$21,900**
    **Scenario 2**: dealer trade-in and purchase
    * $30,000 new car - $12,000 trade-in = $18,000
    * $18,000 + 13% HST = $20,340
    * Total Cost: **$20,340**
