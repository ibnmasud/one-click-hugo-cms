  In most cases, when you trade in your car, the dealer will turn around and
  sell it to another dealer at auction. Now you can skip the middleman and sell
  it at auction yourself.

When you need to get rid of your car, or when it's time to upgrade to a newer model, one of the easiest ways to sell a vehicle is to a dealer as a trade-in. It's pretty easy to do, and when you're buying a new one from the same dealership there can be tax advantages as well. But once you sell your car to the dealer, what do they do with it? Sometimes they just shine it up, add a few thousand dollars to the price tag and roll it out onto their sales floor. Other times, though, if yours isn't the kind of car they sell - say, if they're a new Toyota dealer and you traded in a Honda - they'll sell your old car to another dealer at an auction.

Dealers have tools they use to determine what a vehicle might be worth as a resale, so the price they offer you for yours will be based on this. They don't want to risk losing money, of course, so what you get for your trade-in is going to be less than they expect to get from an auction. "What?" you might say "Why can't I just sell my own car at auction, and keep that money?" Well, now you can.

Autovend has partnered with Canada's largest car auction house, to offer car sellers the ability to list their car at a dealer auction.
