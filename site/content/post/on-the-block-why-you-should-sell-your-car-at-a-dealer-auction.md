  In most cases, when you trade in your car, the dealer will turn around and
  sell it to another dealer at auction. Now you can skip the middleman and sell
  it at auction yourself.

When you need to get rid of your car, or when it's time to upgrade to a newer model, one of the easiest ways to sell a vehicle is to a dealer as a trade-in. It's pretty easy to do, and when you're buying a new one from the same dealership there can be tax advantages as well. But once you sell your car to the dealer, what do they do with it? Sometimes they just shine it up, add a few thousand dollars to the price tag and roll it out onto their sales floor. Other times, though, if yours isn't the kind of car they sell - say, if they're a new Toyota dealer and you traded in a Honda - they'll sell your old car to another dealer at an auction.

Dealers have tools they use to determine what a vehicle might be worth as a resale, so the price they offer you for yours will be based on this. They don't want to risk losing money, of course, so what you get for your trade-in is going to be less than what they expect to get from an auction. "What?" you might say "Why can't I just sell my own car at auction, and keep that money?" Well, now you can.

Autovend has partnered with one of Canada's leading car auction houses to offer car sellers the ability to list their car at a dealer auction. Our trained staff will guide you through the necessary steps, and help you get your car inspected, listed and sold in no time.

After registering your car with Autovend, we'll provide an analysis of what it might be worth, both to a dealer and on the private sale market. Armed with that information, you can begin the auction sale process using our simple [step-by-step guide](https://www.autovend.ca/howtosell#auction). Before you know it, you'll have a cheque in your hand instead of a car in your driveway.

Here's how it works:

1. Register your vehicle with Autovend.ca
2. We'll prepare some data for you, so you can take the next steps well-informed
3. Download and complete auction house consignment form, including setting a minimum price (reserve price)
4. Work with us to schedule an inspection from the auction house
5. The auction house will put your car up for auction. If you get a bid above your reserve price, you've sold your car! Otherwise, we can negotiate with dealer buyers to see what we can get you.
6. When a sale price is agreed, we'll help you schedule a time for the buyer to pick up the car
7. Once the car is out of your hands, you can cancel your insurance and cash the cheque!
