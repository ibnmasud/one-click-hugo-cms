* Multiple steps in the process, none very complicated
* We at Autovend will walk you through it - it's new for everyone

1. Register your vehicle with Autovend.ca
2. We'll prepare some data for you, so you can take the next steps well-informed
3. Download and complete auction house consignment form, including setting a minimum price (reserve price)
4. Work with us to schedule an inspection from the auction house
5. The auction house will put your car up for auction. If you get a bid above your reserve price, you've sold your car! Otherwise, we can negotiate with dealer buyers to see what we can get you.
6. When a sale price is agreed, we'll help you schedule a time for the buyer to pick up the car
7. Once the car is out of your hands, you can cancel your insurance and cash the cheque!
