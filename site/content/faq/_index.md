      In our current beta phase, Autovend doesn’t yet facilitate private sales
      of vehicles. This is certainly something we will be doing in the next
      phase of our growth.
    title: Why can’t I choose the Private Sale option?
  - text: >-
      Trade-in option is pretty much a do-it-yourself kind of deal. Autovend is
      currently looking into how we can better help you through this option.
      Look out for our service offering in a later version of our growth.
    title: Why can’t I choose trade-in option?

      Our car valuation services are provided to you free of charge! If you
      decide to select the auction route to sell your car, our auction house
      partner charges listing and sales fees to inspect the car, place it on
      auction, and handle the necessary transportation/paperwork to complete the
      sale.
    title: How much does it cost to use Autovend’s services?
  - text: >-
      The amount of time it takes to sell your vehicle depends on which
      car-selling path you take. Private sales typically take the longest and
      that process can last months. Trade-ins are typically the shortest path,
      but are best when you’re looking to replace your car and you physically
      take your car to the dealer. Auction lands somewhere in the middle, for
      motivated sellers your car can be sold within a week in most instances.
    title: How long will it take for me to sell my car?
  - text: >-
      Yes, Autovend has already sold several cars for individuals through
      auction.
    title: Have you sold any cars yet in beta phase?

      When you decide to list your car on the auction, you will be asked for a
      reserve price which is the lowest price you are willing to sell your car
      for. If the price offered to you on the auction does not meet your reserve
      price, you can choose to refuse the offer.

      What if I don’t like the auction price offered for my vehicle? Can I
      refuse the offer?

      We provide a number of different sources to establish the value of your
      vehicle, including looking at Canadian Black Book values, reviewing actual
      sold prices on the auction, and looking at list prices on leading online
      car marketplaces to give you an accurate value of your vehicle.
    title: How is the current market value established?
  - text: >-
      That’s not a problem. Ultimately, the price you take for your vehicle is
      up to you. We do our best to give you an accurate scope of the market
      value of your car. There’s no pressure or penalty for not accepting that
      value.
    title: >-
      What if my desired current market value is greater than the calculated
      market value?

      There is a consignment form that you’ll need to fill out as part of the
      process which includes establishing your reserve price. You’ll also need
      to prove that you have the ownership for the vehicle and are authorized to
      sell it. We will also purchase a CarProof Verified (www.CarProof.com)
      report on your behalf as part of the consignment process to help
      professional buyers establish your vehicle’s history.
    title: What information would the auction need to sell my vehicle?
  - text: >-
      As the auction is primarily handled online, there is no physical auction
      to attend. In order to protect both the buyer and seller, we do not.
    title: Can I attend the auction to see who bids on my car?
  - text: >-
      The vehicle should be clean (at a minimum all your personal belongings
      must be removed, vehicle should be de-trashed, vacuumed and washed). If
      you are comfortable with doing a little extra cleaning yourself, you
      should.
    title: Should I clean my car or have it tuned up before sending it to auction?

      1. Simply let the auction representative know that this is your intention,
      and we will have the vehicle transported to the nearest location to have a
      Post-Sale inspection performed; this is a mechanical inspection that is
      paid for by the buying dealer.


      2. The auction will arrange to have your vehicle picked-up at a mutually
      convenient time.


      3. Make sure all the keys you disclosed in the condition report are given
      to the auction driver, or when you deliver the vehicle at auction. We will
      be verifying that all keys are with the vehicle – missing keys mean your
      vehicle cannot be sold as disclosed.


      4. We will gladly pick-up the vehicle from the location of your choice.

      I have reviewed the offers on the vehicle and want to sell it to the
      highest bidding dealer; Now what?
